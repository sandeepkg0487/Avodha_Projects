                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                    see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>

                <p> His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as
                    he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                    although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
                    ewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
                    window at the dull weather.</p>
